we have to print a pattern similar to that of  a **right-angle triangle**, such as:

```
*
**
***
****
```
### You have to follow certain instructions, which are as follows:
* You have to take an integer type variable, and the input of the variable will define the length of the triangle.
* You have to declare another Boolean variable.
* When the value of Boolean is 1 i.e. True, the pattern will be printed as shown above. :point_up:
* But if the value of Boolean is 0 or false, then the triangle will be printed upside down. :point_down:
